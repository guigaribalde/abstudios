I'll help create a Nushell function for this. Let's create a new file to store this function. I'll create it in a standard location for Nushell custom commands.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to create the function:

~/.config/nushell/custom-commands/git-commit-ai.nu
```nu
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def git-commit-ai [] {
    let diff = (git diff)
    let json_body = {
        model: "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
        temperature: 0.0
        messages: [
            {
                role: "system"
                content: "You are a powerful system that understands git diffs and create commit messages. You will be given a git diff and you are expected to answer only with a reasonable and consize git commit message. You answer must contain only the commit message and nothing else. Follow the Conventional Commits Pattern. Get the high level intent of the commit and apply the message following the following framework: <framework>If applied this commit will [THIS IS YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE]</framework><example>feat(scope):[THIS IS YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE]</example>"
            }
            {
                role: "user"
                content: $diff
            }
        ]
    }

    http post -t 'application/json' -H [Authorization 'Bearer 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'] https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions $json_body | get choices.0.message.content
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

To use this function, you'll need to:

1. Create the custom commands directory if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nushell/custom-commands
```

2. Source this file in your Nushell config. You'll need to add this line to your `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`:
```bash
source ~/.config/nushell/custom-commands/git-commit-ai.nu
```

After setting this up, you can use the command simply by typing:
```bash
git-commit-ai
```
